    <h3>TIMES</h3>
    <p>As Sugarload Point Lighthouse is part of NSW National Parks, there are a few important things to note:</p>
    <ul class="list">
    <li>There is effectively no reception! That's right, your phone will not have Google Maps, and is now effectively just a camera. Please download a PDF copy of this page if you are unsure of navigating the single path to the lighthouse at this link.</li><li>Car access past the public carpark (location dot 1) is restricted to lighthouse guests only. As you have all indicated you'll be staying close by, we wolid suggest either walking directly from your accomodation to the carpark, or parking your car here to pick up in the morning. Both options involve then walking the 800m on foot to the lighthouse. There will be lighting and signage to guide you along the way.</li>
    <li>As you'll be walking, consider your shoes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A NOTE ON GIFTS</h3>
    <p>The most important thing to us is that you are able to celebrate with us, on our special day. We appreciate, deeply, the distances that so many of you have travelled for us.<br><br>
    Should you wish to help us celebrate with a gift, a wishing well has been set up at the below link. It will go to a much loved piece of furniture for our home.
