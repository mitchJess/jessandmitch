    <h3></h3>
    <p>Together with their families and closest of friends, Jess and Mitch are now very close to getting hitched &#10024; <br><br>Please join us at Seal Rocks Lighthouse on the mid-north coast of NSW for a small ceremony and an intimate evening on <u>Saturday, September the 2nd.</u><br><br>Ceremony will commence at <u>2:30pm at Sugarloaf Point reserve</u> underneath the lighthouse, followed by drinks, dinner, and dancing at the keeperâ€™s cottage. Dress code is black tie, and as this is a night under the stars, please dress warm - the weather can get pretty wild.</p>

    <h3>DETAILS</h3>
    <p>As Seal Rocks Lighthouse is part of NSW National Parks, there are a few important things to note:</p>
    <ul class="list">
    <li><u>There is no reception!</u> There may be wifi at your accomodation, but there will be none anywhere else. Screenshot this page, or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200294#:~:text=Add%20a%20webpage,-Open%20a%20webpage&text=You%20can%20read%20the%20webpage,Automatically%20Save%20Offline%20is%20on.">make it available offline</a> on your phone. No internet means your phone will just be a camera!
    </li>
    <li>Car access past the public carpark is restricted to lighthouse guests only. As you have all indicated you'll be staying close by, we would suggest either walking directly from your accomodation to the public carpark (location <img class="inlineImage" src="img/mapDots-06.png">), then onwards to the lighthouse, or parking your car at the public carpark to pick up in the morning. 
    </li>
    <li>The walk from the public carpark to the venue (location <img class="inlineImage" src="img/mapDots-07.png">) is a particularly beautiful 800m on foot. There will be lighting and signage to guide you both there and home, but the full moon should do a pretty good job lighting things in the at midnight.</li>
    <li>Therefore, please consider your shoes. Stiletto's will not serve you well &#128128</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A NOTE ON GIFTS</h3>
    <p>The most important thing to us is that you are able to be there to celebrate with us on our special day. We appreciate, deeply, the distances that so many of you have travelled to be here.<br><br>
    Should you wish to help us celebrate with a gift, a wishing well has been set up at the below link. It will go to a much loved piece of furniture for our home.
