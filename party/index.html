    <h3></h3>
    <p>Till death do us party &#128128;<br><br>Hey lovers! We are under 2 weeks out from our special party, and are so excited to be seeing you soon!<br><br>

    Following a small ceremony with our families on the mid-north coast the week prior, we will be hosting a wedding party at Mitch's family home at <a>19 Harley Road, North Avalon</a> on <a>Saturday, September 9th 2023</a>. Arrive at <a>5pm, and stay till late.</a></p>

    <p>The <a>dress code is cocktail</a>, and as this is a night under the stars, please dress warm. Stilettos will need to be left at home - no gal likes to sink into grass mid-conversation.<br><br>

    The bride and groom will arrive at 5:45pm, so fill your glasses ready for a toast, wear your best dancing shoes, and we'll see you there &#129293</p>
    

    <p><i>As we get closer to the day, please re-check this page for any questions you might have. We will continue updating the event info here until the day.</i></p>
