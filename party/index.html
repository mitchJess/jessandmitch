    <p>Till death do us party &#128128; <br><br><a>Todays the day!!!</a><br><br>

    Following a small ceremony with our families on the mid-north coast last week, we are hosting a wedding party at Mitch's family home at <a>19 Harley Road, North Avalon</a> on <a>Saturday, September 9th 2023</a>. Arrive at <a>5pm, and stay till midnight.</a></p>

    <p>The <a>dress code is cocktail</a>, and as this is a night under the stars, please dress warm. The forecast is arctic-grade cold. Stilettos will need to be left at home - no gal likes to sink into grass mid-conversation.<br><br>

    The bride and groom will arrive at 5:45pm, so fill your glasses ready for a toast, wear your best dancing shoes, and we'll see you there &#129293</p>
