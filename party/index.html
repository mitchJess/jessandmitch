    <h3></h3>
    <p>Till death do us party &#128128;<br><br>Hey lovers, the time is getting closer to our special party, and we are beyond excited to be seeing you soon!<br><br>

    Following a small ceremony with our families on the mid-north coast the week prior, we will be hosting a wedding party at Mitch's family home at <u>19 Harley Road, North Avalon</u> on <u>Saturday, September 9th 2023</u>. Arrive at <u>5pm, and stay till late.</u></p>

    <p>The dress code is cocktail, and as this is a night under the stars, please dress warm. Stilettos will need to be left at home - no gal likes to sink into grass mid-conversation.<br><br>

    The bride and groom will arrive at <u>5:45pm</u>, so fill your glasses ready for a toast, wear your best dancing shoes, and we'll see you there &#129293</p>
    

    <p><i>As we get closer to the day, please re-check this page for any questions you might have. We will continue updating the event info here.</i></p>
